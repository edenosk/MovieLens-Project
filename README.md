# MovieLens-Project
This repository contains the complete submission for the HarvardX Data Science Capstone Project. 

This project,develops a sophisticated movie recommendation system utilizing the 10M MovieLens dataset. By analyzing movie and user effects alongside extracted variables like release years and calculated rate timestamps, the model integrates these four predictors to enhance accuracy. Regularization with a cross-validated tuning parameter (Î» = 0.5) ensures robustness. The final model achieves an impressive residual mean squared error (RMSE) of approximately 0.8647 on the validation set, surpassing the target and showcasing its effectiveness in delivering precise movie recommendations.
